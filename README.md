* CSS - Styles the User Interface by enabling formatting of both the text and images and their layout. 
* JQuery- Provides functionality features to various webpage elements where applied 
* Bootstrap-Special CSS libraries used to achieve standardized and predictable results when styling webpages.

##Known Bugs
The main project bugs relate mainly to the use of JavaScript, JQuery and configuring these to work properly to work with the Object properties and their prototypesand generate the expected output. There were some challenges using Bootstrap to apply the required styling and layout to the elements of the webpage.

 Additional bugs also arose when applying functionality to various elements of the webpage using javascript and jquery code, which did not generate the expected output even after persistent debugging.
